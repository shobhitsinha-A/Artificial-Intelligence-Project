# Artificial-Intelligence-Project
This is a project that I worked on with my colleagues in the 6th Semester of my B.tech. In this project, we present a fully automatic method for skin lesion segmentation by leveraging UNet and FCN that is trained end to-end. For Skin lesion disease classification, we use a customized convolutional neural net. Designing a novel loss function based on Jaccard distance to eliminate the need of sample re-weighting, a typical procedure when using cross entropy as the loss function for image segmentation due to the strong imbalance between the number of foreground and background pixels.Â  Evaluated the effectiveness, efficiency, as well as generalization capability of the proposed framework on publicly available PH2 database and HAM10000 dataset.
